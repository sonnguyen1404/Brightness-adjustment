# Brightness-adjustment
This project focuses on researching the optimal multiplier circuit in terms of area and power, besides applying the multiplier circuit to perform simple image processing applications such as increasing and decreasing brightness on the FPGA board. The board I used is Zybo Zynq-7000
# Vivado
Put MUL16.xpr inside your project, then export hardware and create new project on Vitis
# Vitis
Add code "Helloworld.c" into your project and build project
# PC
You must run the code in the file "brightness_control.py" to calculate communication with the FPGA board
